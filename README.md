# uofg-student-alumni-matching-network
AI-powered tool that connects UofG students with alumni using semantic matching. It analyzes career goals and interests to generate personalized networking matches and outreach messages.


# UofG Alumni Matching Network ðŸ”—

This project uses semantic matching and AI to connect University of Guelph students with alumni in related fields. Matches are scored and visualized, and personalized outreach emails are generated automatically.

##  What It Does

- Parses student and alumni survey data
- Generates profiles from free-text responses
- Uses transformer-based models to compare career goals and interests
- Computes similarity scores with penalties/boosts based on keyword overlap
- Produces match rankings, matrices, and personalized outreach messages
- Visualizes the studentâ€“alumni network graphically

##  Tech Used

- Python + Pandas
- `sentence-transformers` (BGE + MPNet models)
- NetworkX + Matplotlib for graph visualization
- Google Gmail API for automated emailing (optional)

##  Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `student_network_match.ipynb` | Main notebook â€” performs matching, scoring, and visualization |
| `data/` | Folder where input survey responses (CSV/XLSX) are stored |
| `outputs/` | Contains match scores, emails, and exported text files |
| `client_secret.json` | Google API secret key   |

##  Email Automation 

- Connects to your Gmail to send out outreach messages
- Requires Gmail API + OAuth setup (see `gmail_send_script.py` for setup)

##  Example Output

- Top 5 matches per student
- Match heatmap
- Semantic network graph of all participants

##  Acknowledgments

Thanks to all UofG students and alumni who participated via the @uog_memes Instagram Page!

This is not a job-matching system â€” itâ€™s a conversation starter. Matches are based on career paths and interests, not hiring potential.
